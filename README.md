# Tarot API

This is my Capstone project for Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

This API allows the user to:
- Look for a Tarot card by ID
- Get a reading for a particular spread
- Ask a question to apply to a reading
- Save a reading to access later
- Add their own interpretation to a reading
- Edit their reading

RBAC is implemented as below:
- A user who has an account but no subscription, can save their readings and access their old readings.
- A user who has an account and a subscription can do all of the above and request AI interpretation for their reading.

- Python
- Relational Database Architecture
- Modeling Data Objects with SQLAlchemy
